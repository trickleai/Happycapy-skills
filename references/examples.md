# Good vs Bad Examples

## Opening Lines

### BAD (AI-Written):
"I wanted to share my experience with the job hunting process. After being laid off, I embarked on a journey that taught me valuable lessons about resilience and organization."

### GOOD (Human-Written):
"Got laid off in November. I have 2 kids and I've been remote since COVID. I need to find another remote job because I need the flexibility with the kids, but this is way harder than I thought it would be."

**Why the second works:**
- Jumps right in, no preamble
- Specific details (November, 2 kids, remote since COVID)
- Honest emotion (way harder than expected)
- No "journey" or "lessons" language

## Describing Struggles

### BAD (AI-Written):
"The organizational challenges became overwhelming as I navigated multiple tracking systems and struggled to maintain consistency."

### GOOD (Human-Written):
"I made a spreadsheet to track applications. Then forgot to update it. Made a new one. Then made another one because I didn't remember which one had the current info. At one point I had 3 different sheets going and wasn't updating any of them."

**Why the second works:**
- Specific progression (one sheet -> two -> three)
- Shows the chaos unfolding
- Admits embarrassing truth
- Natural, rambling structure

## Mentioning Results

### BAD (AI-Written):
"Through implementing this systematic approach, I successfully secured an interview opportunity, demonstrating the effectiveness of organized job hunting strategies."

### GOOD (Human-Written):
"Yesterday I got an interview. First one in over 2 months. I'm trying not to get excited because I've been let down a lot. But it felt really good to see 'let's schedule a call' instead of 'we've moved forward with other candidates.'"

**Why the second works:**
- Simple announcement (I got an interview)
- Context (first in 2 months)
- Emotional guard (trying not to get excited)
- Specific contrast (actual email language)
- Still uncertain (been let down)

## Tool Mention (Subtle Level 2)

### BAD (Too Promotional):
"I discovered Claude Code and used it to build an automated job tracking system. It pulls listings from multiple boards and sends me notifications. This tool has been a game-changer in my search."

### GOOD (Properly Subtle):
"My friend also helped me set something up in Claude that pulls job listings into another tab. Honestly I just know it works, I couldn't recreate it if I tried. Saves me from checking the same 4 boards every morning."

**Why the second works:**
- "My friend helped" (not "I discovered")
- "Something" (vague, not "automated system")
- Immediate disclaimer (couldn't recreate it)
- Small benefit (saves checking boards)
- Not the hero (just a helpful detail)

---

## Closing

### BAD (AI-Written):
"I hope this post helps others who are navigating similar challenges. Remember, persistence and organization are key. You've got this!"

### GOOD (Human-Written):
"But if anyone's figured out how to stay sane during this I'd actually love to know."

**Why the second works:**
- No inspiration language
- Still struggling (asking for help)
- Acknowledges shared challenge
- Invites discussion naturally
- No "you've got this" platitudes

## Title Examples

### GOOD Titles:
- "Got laid off in November with 2 kids - finding remote work is breaking me"
- "Applied to 80 jobs in 2 months, 2 interviews, losing my mind"
- "Can't keep track of my job applications anymore - how are you all staying organized?"

### BAD Titles:
- "My Journey Through Job Hunting: What I Learned"
- "The One Thing Nobody Tells You About Remote Work"
- "How I Went From Laid Off to Employed in 60 Days"

**What makes titles work:**
- Under 80 characters
- Direct and specific, not clever
- Include core problem/emotion
- Casual language ("Got laid off" not "I was laid off")
- No rhetorical questions unless genuinely asking

---

## Specific vs Generic Details

### BAD (Generic):
- "I made some mistakes in my job search"
- "My family asks about my progress"
- "I've been applying to a lot of jobs"

### GOOD (Specific):
- "I applied to the same company twice under different job titles and didn't realize until they rejected me referencing both"
- "My wife asks 'did you hear back from that company?' and I have no idea which one she means because I applied to 15 that week"
- "Applied to maybe 80 jobs in 2 months. Got like 4 auto-rejections the same day"

**Rule:** One embarrassing specific detail > ten generic statements

## Emotional Authenticity Markers to Include

1. **Contradictions:** "I'm usually organized" then "I couldn't keep track of anything"
2. **Self-doubt:** "I don't know if this helps," "Maybe I'm doing this wrong"
3. **Ongoing frustration:** Not resolved, still dealing with it
4. **External pressure:** Family asking, bills due, time running out
5. **Specific mistakes:** Without making them funny anecdotes
6. **Cautious hope:** "I'm trying not to get excited because I've been let down"
7. **Uncertainty:** "I think," "I guess," "maybe," "I don't know"
