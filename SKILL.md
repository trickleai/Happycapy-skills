# Reddit Post Writer

Generate authentic Reddit posts that sound human, avoid AI detection, and spark engagement.

## Quick Start

Gather these 4 inputs from the user:

1. **Target Subreddit(s):** r/jobs, r/RemoteWork, r/careerguidance, etc.
2. **Core Situation:** Brief description (e.g., "laid off parent struggling to find remote work")
3. **Primary Goal:** Share struggle & get support | Ask for advice | Vent frustration | Tell a story | Start discussion
4. **Tool/Product Mention (Optional):** Name + subtlety level 1-10 (recommend 1-3 for authenticity)

## Core Authenticity Principles

### 1. Real Over Polished
Real posts are messy, contradictory, unresolved, and repetitive. NOT perfectly structured essays.

- BAD: "The challenge I faced was multifaceted. First, the organizational burden..."
- GOOD: "I can't keep track of anything anymore. I have like 3 spreadsheets and none of them are updated."

### 2. Specific Over Generic
One embarrassing specific detail > ten generic statements.

- BAD: "I made some mistakes in my job search"
- GOOD: "I applied to the same company twice under different job titles and didn't realize until they rejected me referencing both"

### 3. Struggle Over Solution
People upvote relatability, not success stories.

- WORKS: "I'm drowning and barely figuring it out" / "Anyone else dealing with this?"
- FAILS: "Here's how I solved everything" / "3 steps that changed my life"

### 4. Community Voice
Match each subreddit's culture, language, and values. See `references/subreddits.md` for detailed guides.

### 5. Tools Are Never The Hero
If mentioning a product/tool: mentioned ONCE, briefly, supplementary not solution, include real limitations. Test: Remove the tool mention. Does the post still have value? If no, too promotional.

## Writing Rules

### Voice - DO USE:
- Contractions always (I'm, don't, can't, I'd)
- Reddit casual phrases: "honestly," "tbh," "I mean," "like," "idk," "ngl"
- Short punchy sentences mixed with longer rambling ones
- Sentence fragments ("That's 2 months." "No responses.")
- Self-deprecating humor
- Trailing thoughts ("I don't know..." "or something")
- Specific imperfect numbers ("maybe 80," "like 15")

### Voice - NEVER USE:
- "Here's what I learned" / "Here's the thing"
- "Let me share/explain/tell you"
- "In my experience" / "I want to share"
- "I appreciate [your perspective/this community]"
- "To be fair" / "The bottom line is" / "Looking back" / "Interestingly"
- Rhetorical structures (No X. No Y. Just Z.)
- Perfect parallel phrases or literary metaphors
- Starting paragraphs with "So," "Now," "But here's where"
- **Any phrase you'd see on LinkedIn**

### Structure - Like Venting, Not Essays:
1. **Jump right in** - no "I wanted to share" preamble
2. **Describe the chaos** - specific struggles, embarrassing details, external pressures
3. **What's been tried** - including failures and half-working solutions
4. **Current state** - small wins mixed with continued struggle, cautious hope
5. **Optional closing** - brief solidarity or question, not inspirational

### Paragraphs:
- Mix 1-sentence, 2-sentence, 4-sentence paragraphs randomly
- Never more than 5 sentences in one paragraph
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis

### Emotional Authenticity Markers:
- Contradictions ("I'm usually organized" then "I couldn't keep track")
- Self-doubt ("I don't know if this helps")
- External pressure (family asking, bills due)
- Specific mistakes without making them funny anecdotes
- Cautious hope ("I'm trying not to get excited because I've been let down")

## Title Writing

**Rules:**
- Under 80 characters
- Direct and specific, not clever
- Casual language ("Got laid off" not "I was laid off")
- No rhetorical questions

**Formula:** [Situation] + [Struggle/Emotion] + [Current state if relevant]

**Good:** "Got laid off in November with 2 kids - finding remote work is breaking me"
**Bad:** "My Journey Through Job Hunting: What I Learned"

## Self-Check Framework

Before delivering, verify:

1. **Sound Test:** Read aloud. Would you say this to a friend?
2. **Specificity Test:** Count specific details (need 3-5 minimum)
3. **Promotion Test:** Remove tool mention - does post still have value?
4. **Community Test:** Matches top posts in target subreddit?
5. **Authenticity Test:** Has contradictions, unresolved struggles, self-doubt?

## Output Format

Deliver in this structure:

```

Title: [Ready to copy/paste]

Body: [Full post text]

[Word count: X] [Estimated read time: X seconds]

POSTING STRATEGY

- [Emotional honesty marker]
- [Community language match]

Strongest Elements: [Best paragraph] [Most relatable moment]

COMMENT RESPONSE GUIDE
======================
If someone asks about [tool]: "[Casual response]"
If someone says it sounds fake: "[Authentic response]"
If someone shares similar struggle: "[Empathetic response]"
If someone offers advice: "[Grateful response]"
```

## Committee Review System

After generating the post, simulate review with 7 personas:

| Persona | Role | Key Questions |
|---------|------|---------------|
| **Jade** | Reddit veteran (400k karma) | Would I upvote? Matches top posts? Engagement killers? |
| **Tyler** | Authenticity detector | Any AI language? Banned phrases? Pass read-aloud test? |
| **Marcus** | Professional skeptic | Feels promotional? Tool too prominent? Marketing language? |
| **Devon** | Target audience member | Details feel real? Would someone actually say this? Relatable? |
| **Priya** | Career/topic expert | Timeline realistic? Numbers plausible? Factual issues? |
| **Kai** | BS detector | Weakest line? Too perfect? Where would I call BS? |
| **Jamie** | Reddit mod | Violates rules? Would I remove this? Spam filter risks? |

**Final Verdict:**
- APPROVED - Ready to post
- NEEDS MINOR TWEAKS - 90% there
- NEEDS REWRITE - Major issues

## Iteration Commands

User can request:
- **"alternatives"** - 2-3 different versions
- **"expand [section]"** - Detailed analysis
- **"revise [feedback]"** - Adjust based on notes
- **"another subreddit"** - Adapt for different community
- **"committee debate"** - Detailed persona discussion
- **"revise based on [persona]"** - Apply specific feedback
- **"more vulnerable/less desperate/shorter/more specific"** - Tone adjustments
